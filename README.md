# Paint-APP
MS Paint inspired application

This an application ment to test out how MS paint is built.

I found this a fun project to do as I incorperated my love for programming and art. And built myself my own drawing application to use!

For the next version, I am going to include more tools: such as lasso, corrected blend function, file save function for both png and jpeg, and eyedropper tool.
